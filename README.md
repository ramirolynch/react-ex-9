# React Routing Params Exercise

# Objective
The main objective of this exercise is to demonstrate how to use routes provided by 'react-router-dom'. Index.tsx shows how the header component is located inside the BrowserRouter Tag but before the Routes tag. This accomplishes the goal of having the Header component display across the different routes. The App.tsx file contains the App component which in turn contains both the MenuRoute and the SearchRoute components.
